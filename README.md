# ðŸš€ Amazon S3 Project Overview

Just wrapped up a thrilling Amazon S3 projectâ€”challenge mode engaged!

## Project Highlights
- âœ… Created and configured an Amazon S3 bucket, complete with ACLs, versioning, and public access.
- âœ… Uploaded website content, diving deep into how static websites function and how to host them on S3.
- âœ… Tackled public access settings and fixed an interesting challenge with the website's visibility.
